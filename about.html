		<p class="text">I am an User Experience Designer. I have completed my Bachelors in Engineering and then pursued my studies in UX Design and Interactive Media Management. Along with my studies, I also work part-time at McDonaldâ€™s, Canada. Therefore, customer service has become a part of my life. This helped me a lot to understand user experience design and also the activities conducted in this field. Gradually, I started developing interest in prototyping and logo design which came along with it.</p>
